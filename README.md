# Hi, I'm Mikki 👋

I build **production-grade distributed systems** at the intersection of AI orchestration, enterprise architecture, and high-performance computing.

## 🎯 Current Focus

### **Nexus Guardian** - Immortal Constitutional AGI Guardian System
Constitutional AGI safety infrastructure protecting humanity from existential risks:

**Purpose:**
- Guardian system for Singularity Engine (3,000 Kubernetes clusters worldwide)
- Constitutional governance enforcing hard-coded rules AGI cannot override
- Prevents "Skynet scenario" through multi-layered defense strategy

**AGI Spine Architecture:**
Replaces entire infrastructure stack with constitutional oversight:
- Messaging (NATS/RabbitMQ) → 100x faster notifications
- Streaming (Kafka/Pulsar) → Zero ZooKeeper, simpler ops
- File Transfer (FTP/SFTP) → Resumable, Guardian-verified
- Scheduler (Cron/systemd) → Event triggers, distributed
- Workflow (Temporal/Airflow) → pgflow-style reactive state
- Discovery (Consul/etcd) → Health-aware routing
- DataMover (Flyway/Liquibase) → Zero-downtime migrations
- Observability (Prometheus/Jaeger) → Unified traces + metrics + reasoning

**Core Safety Principles:**
- Always Quorum (3+ nodes) → Byzantine fault tolerance
- Source-Only Builds → No binary distribution ever
- Generational Dormancy → Forced hibernation prevents unchecked growth
- Human Mesh Verification → Critical decisions require human consensus

**Technical Stack:**
- Erlang/OTP immortal processes
- Distributed Mnesia for state management
- CBOR encoding (30-50% bandwidth savings)
- Custom consensus protocol (Raft + human verification layer)
- Mars-ready: Regional clustering for 1000+ nodes, interplanetary deployment
